  * When Julie Miller began writing her successful developmental math series, one of her primary goals was to bridge the gap between preparatory courses and college algebra. For thousands of students, the Miller/O’Neill/Hyde (or M/O/H) series has provided a solid foundation in developmental mathematics. With the Miller College Algebra series, Julie has carried forward her clear, concise writing style; highly effective pedagogical features; and complete author-created technological package to students in this course area.
